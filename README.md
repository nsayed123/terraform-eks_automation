# Terraform Module: Kubernetes Platform with Managed PostgreSQL

This Terraform module sets up a complete Kubernetes-based application platform on **AWS**, including:

- âœ… **Amazon EKS** (Kubernetes)
- âœ… **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**
- âœ… **NGINX ingress controllers** (public & private)
- âœ… **Let's Encrypt TLS certificates via cert-manager**
- âœ… **DNS records in Route53**

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **EKS Cluster** with optional node groups and IAM configuration
- **Managed PostgreSQL** via Amazon RDS
- **NGINX Ingress Controllers**:
  - Public ingress for internet-facing traffic
  - Private ingress for internal services
- **TLS Certificates** from Let's Encrypt using `cert-manager`
- **DNS Automation** using AWS Route53

---

## ðŸ§± Prerequisites

Before using this module, ensure the following are in place:
- Terraform
- aws cli
- git (only to clone this repository)

## Installation

The commands below set everything up to run the Kubernetes Platform with Managed PostgreSQL:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nsayed123/terraform-eks_automation.git
```

## NOTE:
1. We will run networking and infrastructure(eks and rds) separately because our EKS will be setup private.
2. Create S3 bucket to save terraform state files and dynamodb for lock.
3. Before running the terraform init change the profile and region in the provider.tf file.
4. Create an aws credentials profile.
```
aws configure --profile <profilename>
```
5. Update the profile name in the provider.tf.
6. Change the required values in terraform.tfvars


## Run
### Networking
#### Steps
1. Create S3 bucket to save terraform state file and dynamodb for lock.
2. Create ssh key in AWS i.e Key pairs.
3. ``` cd terraform-eks_automation/networking ```
4. Configure the backend in backend.tf accordingly.
5. Change the values under tfvars/terraform.tfvars files based on your requirements.
    NOTE: you can name this file whatever makes sense. ex: based on environments
6. 
```
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=tfvars/terraform.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=tfvars/terraform.tfvars

If everything looks good type `yes` and hit `Enter` 
```
This will set the base Networking for you. It will output the Public IP of the bastion. This machine is public but will be available from your local has it has restriction in security group. <br />
ssh into the bastion machine.

```
ssh -i <ap-south-1.pem> ec2-user@<bastion_public_ip>
```

### infrastructure
#### Steps
1. Create S3 bucket to save terraform state file and dynamodb for lock
2. Once logged into bastion
3. ``` git clone https://github.com/nsayed123/terraform-eks_automation.git ```
4. ``` cd terraform-eks_automation/infrastructure ```
5. Configure the backend in backend.tf accordingly.

5. Change the values under tfvars/terraform.tfvars files based on your requirements
    NOTE: you can name this file whatever makes sense. ex: based on environments <br />
*** Important ***
> These keys in the tfvars are important here these gets the subnet values from previous networking output state file. Please set these accordingly
>> network_tfstate_bucket <br />
>> network_tfstate_key <br />
>> network_tfstate_region <br />
>> network_tfstate_profile <br />
6. 
```
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=tfvars/terraform.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=tfvars/terraform.tfvars

If everything looks good type `yes` and hit `Enter` 
```
7. Once the terraform apply is completed run the below command in the bastion machine
```
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region> --name <your_cluster_mame>
```
## Destroy
If you want to destroy run in bation as well as on local to destroy both networking and infrastructure
```
terraform destroy -var-file=tfvars/terraform.tfvars
```
type `yes` and hit `Enter`
